\title{Doubly constrained accessibility}
\value{
A \code{data.table}/\code{data.frame} with either OD-level flows (\code{detailed_results = TRUE})
or marginals; see Details.
}
\description{
Calculates accessibility using Wilson's doubly-constrained gravity model.
This measure allocates flows between origins and destinations such that
origin totals equal demand and destination totals equal supply.
Internal helper used by \code{\link[=constrained_accessibility]{constrained_accessibility()}} when \code{constraint = "doubly"}.
