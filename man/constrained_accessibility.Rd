\arguments{
\item{constraint}{A string. One of \code{"total"}, \code{"singly"}, or \code{"doubly"}.}

\item{travel_matrix}{A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs
(i.e. travel time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns \code{from_id}, \code{to_id}
and any others specified in \code{travel_cost}.}

\item{land_use_data}{A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within
the study area cells. Must contain the columns \code{id} and any others
specified in \code{opportunity}.}

\item{travel_cost}{A string. The name of the column in \code{travel_matrix}
with the travel cost between origins and destinations.}

\item{decay_function}{A \code{fuction} that converts travel cost into an
impedance factor used to weight opportunities. This function should take a
\code{numeric} vector and also return a \code{numeric} vector as output, with the
same length as the input. For convenience, the package currently includes
the following functions: \code{\link[=decay_binary]{decay_binary()}}, \code{\link[=decay_exponential]{decay_exponential()}},
\code{\link[=decay_power]{decay_power()}} and \code{\link[=decay_stepped]{decay_stepped()}}. See the documentation of each decay
function for more details.}

\item{demand}{A string. The name of the column in \code{land_use_data} with the
number of opportunity-demanders at each origin (e.g., people) that will be
considered.}

\item{supply}{A string. The name of the column in \code{land_use_data} with the
number of opportunity supply at each destination (e.g., jobs, school-seats)
that will be considered.}

\item{return_demand_side}{Logical for \code{"total"} and \code{"singly"}, must be \code{NULL} for \code{"doubly"}.}

\item{error_threshold}{Numeric. Convergence criterion for doubly-constrained case.}

\item{improvement_threshold}{Numeric. Convergence criterion for improvement.}

\item{max_iterations}{Integer. Maximum iterations for doubly-constrained calibration.}

\item{group_by}{A \code{character} vector. When not \code{character(0)} (the default),
indicates the \code{travel_matrix} columns that should be used to group the
accessibility estimates by. For example, if \code{travel_matrix} includes a
departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry in
the data frame, passing \code{"departure_time"} to this parameter results in
accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure time.}

\item{fill_missing_ids}{A \code{logical}. When calculating grouped accessibility
estimates (i.e. when \code{by_col} is not \code{NULL}), some combinations of groups
and origins may be missing. For example, if a single trip can depart from
origin \code{A} at 7:15am and reach destination \code{B} within 55 minutes, but no
trips departing from \code{A} at 7:30am can be completed at all, this second
combination will not be included in the output. When \code{TRUE} (the default),
the function identifies which combinations would be left out and fills
their respective accessibility values with 0, which incurs in a
performance penalty.}

\item{detailed_results}{Logical. Whether to return detailed OD-level results.}
}
\description{
Calculates accessibility using constrained gravity models, as proposed in
\insertCite{soukhov2025family;textual}{accessibility}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"total"}: Allocates total opportunities proportionally based on travel impedance.
\item \code{"singly"}: Allocates opportunities proportionally, constrained on one side (demand or supply).
\item \code{"doubly"}: Allocates flows so origin totals equal demand and destination totals equal supply.
Please see the Details section for more information.
}

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost,
such as distance, time and money.

\section{Details}{

This function covers the family of constrained accessibility measures
proposed in \insertCite{soukhov2025family;textual}{accessibility}.
\subsection{Total constrained accessibility}{

Sum of accessibility equals total opportunities (supply) in the region.
It allocates total opportunities in the region proportionally based on travel
impedance. Uses the logic of a total ~(or unconstrained by Wilon's terms)~
constraint. Returns values as either \code{demand} or \code{supply}. When
\code{return_demand_side = TRUE} (market potential variant) is also available.
}

\subsection{Singly constrained accessibility}{

Allocates opportunities at each destination proportionally based on travel
impedance and population at the origin. Uses the logic of single constraint
from \insertCite{wilson1971family;textual}{accessibility}. Returns values as
either 'demand' or 'supply'. Supply-constrained (destination totals fixed)
when \code{return_demand_side = FALSE}. In either case, totals match either the
demand at each origin or supply at each destination, depending on variant.
}

\subsection{Doubly constrained accessibility}{

Calculates accessibility using doubly-constrained gravity model of
\insertCite{wilson1971family;textual}{accessibility}. This measure allocates
flows between origins and destinations such that origin totals equal demand
and destination totals equal supply. Iterative proportional fitting updates
(A_i) and (B_j) until convergence. This ensures that row sums equal (O_i)
(demand) and column sums equal (D_j) (supply). Note, only OD-level outputs
are available (as aggregate outputs just match inputs).
