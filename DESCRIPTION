Description: A set of fast and convenient functions to calculate multiple
    transport accessibility measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost
    matrix and a land use dataset (containing the location of jobs,
    healthcare and population, for example), the package allows one to
    calculate active and passive accessibility levels using multiple
    accessibility measures, such as: cumulative opportunities (using
    either travel cost cutoffs or intervals), minimum travel cost to
    closest N number of activities, gravity-based (with different decay
    functions) and different floating catchment area methods.
