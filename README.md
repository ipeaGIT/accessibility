**accessibility** offers a set of fast and convenient functions to help
conducting accessibility analyses. Given a pre-computed travel cost
matrix and a land use dataset (containing the location of jobs,
healthcare and population, for example), the package allows one to
calculate accessibility levels and accessibility poverty and inequality.
The package covers the majority of the most commonly used accessibility
measures (such as cumulative opportunities, gravity-based and floating
catchment areas methods), as well as the most frequently used inequality
and poverty metrics (such as the Palma ratio, the concentration and
Theil indices and the FGT family of measures).

## Installation

Stable version:

``` r
install.packages("accessibility")
```

Development version:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ipeaGIT/accessibility")
```

## Usage

This section aims to present a very brief overview of some of the
packagesâ€™ features. Fore more details please read the vignettes:

  - [Introduction to **accessibility**: calculating accessibility
    measures](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/articles/accessibility.html)
  - [Decay
    functions](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/articles/decay_functions.html)
  - [Calculating accessibility inequality and
    poverty](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/articles/inequality_and_poverty.html)

To calculate accessibility levels, one simply needs a pre-calculated
travel matrix and some land use data. Below we showcase some of the
available functions:

``` r
library(accessibility)

data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "accessibility")
travel_matrix <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, "travel_matrix.rds"))
land_use_data <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, "land_use_data.rds"))

cum_cutoff <- cumulative_cutoff(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity = "jobs",
  travel_cost = "travel_time",
  cutoff = 30
)
head(cum_cutoff)
#>                 id  jobs
#> 1: 89a881a5a2bffff 14561
#> 2: 89a881a5a2fffff 29452
#> 3: 89a881a5a67ffff 16647
#> 4: 89a881a5a6bffff 10700
#> 5: 89a881a5a6fffff  6669
#> 6: 89a881a5b03ffff 37029

grav <- gravity(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity = "schools",
  travel_cost = "travel_time",
  decay_function = decay_exponential(decay_value = 0.2)
)
head(grav)
#>                 id    schools
#> 1: 89a88cdb57bffff 0.03041853
#> 2: 89a88cdb597ffff 1.15549493
#> 3: 89a88cdb5b3ffff 0.56519126
#> 4: 89a88cdb5cfffff 0.19852152
#> 5: 89a88cd909bffff 0.41378042
#> 6: 89a88cd90b7ffff 0.95737555

fca <- floating_catchment_area(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity = "jobs",
  travel_cost = "travel_time",
  demand = "population",
  method = "2sfca",
  decay_function = decay_binary(cutoff = 50)
)
head(fca)
#>                 id      jobs
#> 1: 89a88cdb57bffff 0.4278111
#> 2: 89a88cdb597ffff 0.3863614
#> 3: 89a88cdb5b3ffff 0.4501725
#> 4: 89a88cdb5cfffff 0.5366707
#> 5: 89a88cd909bffff 0.4280401
#> 6: 89a88cd90b7ffff 0.5176583
```

Calculating inequality and poverty levels is equally easy. Below we use
the previously calculated cumulative accessibility dataset to show some
of the available inequality and poverty functions:

``` r
palma <- palma_ratio(
  cum_cutoff,
  sociodemographic_data = land_use_data,
  opportunity = "jobs",
  population = "population",
  income = "income_per_capita"
)
palma
#>    palma_ratio
#> 1:    3.800465

poverty <- fgt_poverty(
  cum_cutoff,
  sociodemographic_data = land_use_data,
  opportunity = "jobs",
  population = "population",
  poverty_line = 95368
)
poverty
#>         FGT0      FGT1      FGT2
#> 1: 0.5745378 0.3277383 0.2218769
```
