# Spatial availability

Calculates spatial availability, an accessibility measured proposed by
Soukhov et al. (2023) that takes into account competition effects. The
accessibility levels that result from using this measure are
proportional both to the demand in each origin and to the travel cost it
takes to reach the destinations. The spatial availability is a
particular case of `constrained_accessibility(constraint = "singly")`.

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost, such as
distance, time and money.

## Usage

``` r
spatial_availability(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity,
  travel_cost,
  demand,
  decay_function,
  alpha = 1,
  group_by = character(0),
  fill_missing_ids = TRUE,
  detailed_results = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- travel_matrix:

  A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs (i.e. travel
  time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
  destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns `from_id`,
  `to_id` and any others specified in `travel_cost`.

- land_use_data:

  A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within the study area
  cells. Must contain the columns `id` and any others specified in
  `opportunity`.

- opportunity:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunities/resources/services to be considered when calculating
  accessibility levels.

- travel_cost:

  A string. The name of the column in `travel_matrix` with the travel
  cost between origins and destinations.

- demand:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunity-demanders at each origin (e.g., people) that will be
  considered.

- decay_function:

  A `fuction` that converts travel cost into an impedance factor used to
  weight opportunities. This function should take a `numeric` vector and
  also return a `numeric` vector as output, with the same length as the
  input. For convenience, the package currently includes the following
  functions:
  [`decay_binary()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_binary.md),
  [`decay_exponential()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_exponential.md),
  [`decay_power()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_power.md)
  and
  [`decay_stepped()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_stepped.md).
  See the documentation of each decay function for more details.

- alpha:

  A `numeric`. A parameter used to modulate the effect of demand by
  population. When less than 1, opportunities are allocated more rapidly
  to smaller centers relative to larger ones; values higher than 1
  achieve the opposite effect.

- group_by:

  A `character` vector. When not `character(0)` (the default), indicates
  the `travel_matrix` columns that should be used to group the
  accessibility estimates by. For example, if `travel_matrix` includes a
  departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry
  in the data frame, passing `"departure_time"` to this parameter
  results in accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure
  time.

- fill_missing_ids:

  A `logical`. When calculating grouped accessibility estimates (i.e.
  when `by_col` is not `NULL`), some combinations of groups and origins
  may be missing. For example, if a single trip can depart from origin
  `A` at 7:15am and reach destination `B` within 55 minutes, but no
  trips departing from `A` at 7:30am can be completed at all, this
  second combination will not be included in the output. When `TRUE`
  (the default), the function identifies which combinations would be
  left out and fills their respective accessibility values with 0, which
  incurs in a performance penalty.

- detailed_results:

  A `logical`. Whether to return spatial availability results aggregated
  by origin-destination pair (`TRUE`) or by origin (`FALSE`, the
  default). When `TRUE`, the output also includes the demand, impedance
  and combined balancing factors used to calculate spatial availability.
  Please note that the argument `fill_missing_ids` does not affect the
  output when `detailed_results` is `TRUE`.

## Value

A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each
origin/destination (depending if `active` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`) in the
travel matrix.
