# Gravity-based accessibility measures

Calculates gravity-based accessibility using a decay function specified
by the user.

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost, such as
distance, time and money.

## Usage

``` r
gravity(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity,
  travel_cost,
  decay_function,
  group_by = character(0),
  active = TRUE,
  fill_missing_ids = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- travel_matrix:

  A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs (i.e. travel
  time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
  destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns `from_id`,
  `to_id` and any others specified in `travel_cost`.

- land_use_data:

  A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within the study area
  cells. Must contain the columns `id` and any others specified in
  `opportunity`.

- opportunity:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunities/resources/services to be considered when calculating
  accessibility levels.

- travel_cost:

  A string. The name of the column in `travel_matrix` with the travel
  cost between origins and destinations.

- decay_function:

  A `fuction` that converts travel cost into an impedance factor used to
  weight opportunities. This function should take a `numeric` vector and
  also return a `numeric` vector as output, with the same length as the
  input. For convenience, the package currently includes the following
  functions:
  [`decay_binary()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_binary.md),
  [`decay_exponential()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_exponential.md),
  [`decay_power()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_power.md)
  and
  [`decay_stepped()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/decay_stepped.md).
  See the documentation of each decay function for more details.

- group_by:

  A `character` vector. When not `character(0)` (the default), indicates
  the `travel_matrix` columns that should be used to group the
  accessibility estimates by. For example, if `travel_matrix` includes a
  departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry
  in the data frame, passing `"departure_time"` to this parameter
  results in accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure
  time.

- active:

  A logical. When `TRUE`, the function calculates active accessibility
  (the quantity of opportunities that can be reached from a given
  origin). when `FALSE`, it calculates passive accessibility (by how
  many people each destination can be reached), which is equivalent to
  the notion of market potential.

- fill_missing_ids:

  A `logical`. When calculating grouped accessibility estimates (i.e.
  when `by_col` is not `NULL`), some combinations of groups and origins
  may be missing. For example, if a single trip can depart from origin
  `A` at 7:15am and reach destination `B` within 55 minutes, but no
  trips departing from `A` at 7:30am can be completed at all, this
  second combination will not be included in the output. When `TRUE`
  (the default), the function identifies which combinations would be
  left out and fills their respective accessibility values with 0, which
  incurs in a performance penalty.

## Value

A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each
origin/destination (depending if `active` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`) in the
travel matrix.

## Examples

``` r
data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "accessibility")
travel_matrix <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, "travel_matrix.rds"))
land_use_data <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, "land_use_data.rds"))

df_linear <- gravity(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  decay_function = decay_linear(cutoff = 50),
  opportunity = "schools",
  travel_cost = "travel_time"
)
head(df_linear)
#>                 id schools
#>             <char>   <num>
#> 1: 89a88cdb57bffff   9.260
#> 2: 89a88cdb597ffff  18.748
#> 3: 89a88cdb5b3ffff  20.900
#> 4: 89a88cdb5cfffff  13.660
#> 5: 89a88cd909bffff  18.980
#> 6: 89a88cd90b7ffff  24.780

df_exp <- gravity(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  decay_function = decay_exponential(decay_value = 0.5),
  opportunity = "schools",
  travel_cost = "travel_time"
)
head(df_exp)
#>                 id      schools
#>             <char>        <num>
#> 1: 89a88cdb57bffff 2.705781e-06
#> 2: 89a88cdb597ffff 1.249277e-01
#> 3: 89a88cdb5b3ffff 8.269861e-03
#> 4: 89a88cdb5cfffff 3.023943e-03
#> 5: 89a88cd909bffff 3.059679e-02
