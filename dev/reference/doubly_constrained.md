# Doubly constrained accessibility

Calculates accessibility using Wilson's doubly-constrained gravity
model. This measure allocates flows between origins and destinations
such that origin totals equal demand and destination totals equal
supply. This is an internal helper function used by
[`constrained_accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/constrained_accessibility.md)
when `constraint = "doubly"`.

## Value

A `data.table`/`data.frame` with either OD-level flows
(`detailed_results = TRUE`) or marginals; see Details.

## Examples

``` r
NULL
#> NULL
```
