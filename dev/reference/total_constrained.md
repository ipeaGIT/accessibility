# Total constrained accessibility

Allocates total opportunities in the region proportionally based on
travel impedance. Uses the logic of a total (or unconstrained by Wilon's
terms) constraint. Returns values as either 'demand' or 'supply'. This
is an internal helper function used by
[`constrained_accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/dev/reference/constrained_accessibility.md)
when `constraint = "total"`.

## Value

A `data.table`/`data.frame` with results (structure mirrors the
wrapper).

## Examples

``` r
NULL
#> NULL
```
