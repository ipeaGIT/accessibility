# Balancing cost accessibility measure

Calculates the balancing cost measure, which is defined as the travel
cost required to reach as many opportunities as the number of people in
a given origin. Originally proposed by Barboza et al. (2021) , under the
name "balancing time".

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost, such as
distance, time and money.

## Usage

``` r
balancing_cost(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity,
  travel_cost,
  demand,
  cost_increment = 1,
  group_by = character(0),
  fill_missing_ids = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- travel_matrix:

  A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs (i.e. travel
  time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
  destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns `from_id`,
  `to_id` and any others specified in `travel_cost`.

- land_use_data:

  A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within the study area
  cells. Must contain the columns `id` and any others specified in
  `opportunity`.

- opportunity:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunities/resources/services to be considered when calculating
  accessibility levels.

- travel_cost:

  A string. The name of the column in `travel_matrix` with the travel
  cost between origins and destinations. The notion of cost here is
  generic over any kind of numeric travel cost, such as distance, time
  and money.

- demand:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunity-demanders at each origin (e.g., people) that will be
  considered.

- cost_increment:

  A number. The cost increment that should be used when defining the
  travel cost distribution from which the potential balancing costs will
  be picked. For example, an increment of 1 tends to suitable for travel
  time distributions, meaning that the function will first check if any
  origins reach their balancing cost with a travel time of 0 minutes,
  then 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3, 4, ..., etc. A increment of 1 might be
  too big for a distribution of monetary costs, on the other hand, which
  could possibly benefit from a smaller increment of 0.05, for example,
  resulting in the function looking for balancing costs first at a cost
  of 0, then 0.05, 0.10, ..., etc. Defaults to 1.

- group_by:

  A `character` vector. When not `character(0)` (the default), indicates
  the `travel_matrix` columns that should be used to group the
  accessibility estimates by. For example, if `travel_matrix` includes a
  departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry
  in the data frame, passing `"departure_time"` to this parameter
  results in accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure
  time.

- fill_missing_ids:

  A `logical`. When calculating grouped accessibility estimates (i.e.
  when `by_col` is not `NULL`), some combinations of groups and origins
  may be missing. For example, if a single trip can depart from origin
  `A` at 7:15am and reach destination `B` within 55 minutes, but no
  trips departing from `A` at 7:30am can be completed at all, this
  second combination will not be included in the output. When `TRUE`
  (the default), the function identifies which combinations would be
  left out and fills their respective accessibility values with 0, which
  incurs in a performance penalty.

## Value

A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each
origin/destination (depending if `active` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`) in the
travel matrix.

A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each origin in
the travel matrix. Origins marked with a `NA` balancing cost never reach
as many opportunities as there is people residing in them, given the
specified travel matrix.
