# accessibility: Transport accessibility measures

A set of fast and convenient functions to help conducting accessibility
analyses. Given a pre-computed travel cost matrix and a land use dataset
(containing the location of jobs, healthcare and population, for
example), the package allows one to calculate accessibility levels and
accessibility poverty and inequality. The package covers the majority of
the most commonly used accessibility measures (such as cumulative
opportunities, gravity-based and floating catchment areas methods), some
cutting edge measures proposed in the literature (e.g. balancing cost
and constrained accessibility) as well as the most frequently used
inequality and poverty metrics (such as the Palma ratio, the
concentration and Theil indices and the FGT family of measures).
