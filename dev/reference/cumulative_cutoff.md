# Cumulative access based on a travel cost cutoff

Calculates the number of opportunities accessible under a given
specified travel cost cutoff.

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost, such as
distance, time and money.

## Usage

``` r
cumulative_cutoff(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  opportunity,
  travel_cost,
  cutoff,
  group_by = character(0),
  active = TRUE,
  fill_missing_ids = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- travel_matrix:

  A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs (i.e. travel
  time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
  destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns `from_id`,
  `to_id` and any others specified in `travel_cost`.

- land_use_data:

  A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within the study area
  cells. Must contain the columns `id` and any others specified in
  `opportunity`.

- opportunity:

  A string. The name of the column in `land_use_data` with the number of
  opportunities/resources/services to be considered when calculating
  accessibility levels.

- travel_cost:

  A `character` vector. The name of the columns in `travel_matrix` with
  the travel costs between origins and destinations to be considered in
  the calculation.

- cutoff:

  Either a `numeric` vector or a list of `numeric` vectors, one for each
  cost specified in `travel_cost`. The travel cost cutoffs to consider
  when calculating accessibility levels. If a list, the function finds
  every single possible cutoff combination and use them to calculate
  accessibility (e.g. if one specifies that travel time cutoffs should
  be 30 and 60 minutes and that monetary cost cutoffs should be 5 and 10
  dollars, the output includes accessibility estimates limited at 30 min
  & 5 dollars, 30 min & 10 dollars, 60 min & 5 dollars and 60 min & 10
  dollars). In these cases, cost constraints are considered
  simultaneously - i.e. only trips that take 30 minutes or less AND 5
  dollars or less to be completed, for example, are included in the
  accessibility output. The cutoff parameter is not included in the
  final output if the input includes only a single cutoff for a single
  travel cost.

- group_by:

  A `character` vector. When not `character(0)` (the default), indicates
  the `travel_matrix` columns that should be used to group the
  accessibility estimates by. For example, if `travel_matrix` includes a
  departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry
  in the data frame, passing `"departure_time"` to this parameter
  results in accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure
  time.

- active:

  A logical. Whether to calculate active accessibility (the of
  opportunities that can be reached from a given origin, the default) or
  passive accessibility (by how many people each destination can be
  reached).

- fill_missing_ids:

  A `logical`. Calculating cumulative accessibility may result in
  missing ids if the they cannot reach any of the destinations within
  the specified travel cost cutoff. For example, using a travel time
  cutoff of 20 minutes, when estimating the accessibility of origin `A`
  that can only reach destinations with more than 40 minutes results in
  id `A` not being included in the output. When `TRUE` (the default),
  the function identifies which origins would be left out and fills
  their respective accessibility values with 0, which incurs in a
  performance penalty.

## Value

A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each
origin/destination (depending if `active` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`) in the
travel matrix.
